    I would like to learn <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">HTML language</a> in order to understand <strong>how computer <u>programming</u> works</strong>.
<p style="margin-top:40px;">For example, say you’re writing a blog post about how to address an envelope or package. You want to include an example of how to format the sender’s and recipient’s addresses. In that case, you could use the line break element to place the sender’s and recipient’s names, street addresses, and cities, states, and ZIP codes all on separate lines.</p>

<p>Below you’ll see the same address rendered in two different ways. The first uses one paragraph element and multiple line breaks. The second uses multiple paragraph elements and no line breaks. As a result, unnecessary padding and margins are added between lines.</p>
