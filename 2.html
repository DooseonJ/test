    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
<p style="margin-top:40px;">For example, say you’re writing a blog post about how to address an envelope or package. You want to include an example of how to format the sender’s and recipient’s addresses. In that case, you could use the line break element to place the sender’s and recipient’s names, street addresses, and cities, states, and ZIP codes all on separate lines.</p>

<p>Below you’ll see the same address rendered in two different ways. The first uses one paragraph element and multiple line breaks. The second uses multiple paragraph elements and no line breaks. As a result, unnecessary padding and margins are added between lines.</p>
